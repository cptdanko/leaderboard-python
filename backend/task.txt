Build a leaderboard application that shows user scores in descending order.

Backend

- it has the get scores endpoint [returns a list]
- it has a write scores endpoint
- it stores data in a NoSql application (write heavy)
- it secures the API endpoint by JWT auth

Frontend

A react app powered by MUI that shows a table of scores.
- simple UI powered by react-mui
- a component to sign-in/sign-up
- a component to show a table / list of scores (simple UI nothing fancy)

[Optional]: it applies a BFF pattern and it let's end users search by username
